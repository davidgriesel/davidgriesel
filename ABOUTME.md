# Hello, my name is David, and welcome to my GitHub page!

I'm a data analyst with a background in accounting and auditing, who transitioned into data analytics after working extensively with financial databases.

Being curious by nature, I enjoy uncovering patterns, connections, and trends in large datasets — learning how to use new tools and techniques that turn raw data into practical insight and value — and finding smarter, more efficient ways to work.

This is where I showcase a few projects, each one highlighting the different tools I use, the skills I’ve developed, and the progress I’m making as I continue to grow in the field of data analytics.

Thanks for visiting!

### About Me
I’m a data analyst with a background in accounting and auditing that started out supporting small businesses with financial reporting and analysis, before moving into public sector audit. 

Working with financial databases gave me a solid understanding of how data is structured, processed, and used to support decision-making. As I progressed to larger and more complex datasets, I began applying this knowledge to improve audit processes through data analytics and computer-assisted audit techniques (CAATs).

This evolved into a dedicated role in data analytics, where I developed custom scripts, eliminated repetitive tasks, and streamlined workflows, to improve efficiency and audit quality.

Since then, I’ve expanded my skills in coding, statistics, advanced analytics, and data visualisation-building on that foundation to support more strategic and exploratory data work.

Today, I apply these principles to projects that uncover insights, improve processes, and contribute to better decision-making through data.
