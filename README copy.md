# Video Game Market Analysis: GameCo

*This project was completed as part of the [CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program](https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-data-analyst/).*


## Project Overview

### Background
GameCo’s board is preparing the 2017 marketing budget and assumes that regional video game sales trends and market shares remained consistent over time. This analysis test that assumption.

### Key Questions
- Are certain types of games more popular than others?
- What publishers dominate specific markets or regions?
- Have any games or genres increased or decreased in popularity over time?
- Have regional sales trends shifted, or do they remain consistent?

## Takeaways
### Successes
This project successfully addressed the core objectives by uncovering actionable insights into customer genre preferences, regional market shifts, and evolving publisher dynamics. The analysis provided clear answers to executive questions and helped debunk the assumption that regional trends and market shares had remained consistent. Importantly, the investigation also confirmed—through observable data patterns—the industry’s shift away from physical formats toward digital distribution.

### Challenges Faced
One of the key challenges was managing scope. With so many interesting patterns in the data, it was easy to pursue additional analyses beyond the original brief. This sometimes led to detours that, while informative, didn’t always align closely with executive priorities. Balancing analytical depth with audience relevance—particularly in an executive-facing context—was a learning curve. There’s also an ongoing temptation to over-communicate findings, when concise messaging would often be more effective.

### Next Steps
Going forward, the focus should be on staying aligned with stakeholder objectives before exploring adjacent questions. While detail adds value—especially in exploratory workbooks—future executive materials should prioritise clarity and focus. Insights should be summarised concisely on slides using brief bullets or headlines, while more detailed explanations are reserved for presenter notes to support verbal delivery. 

A logical next step for this project would be to investigate the availability of digital sales data. Analysing physical and digital market trends in parallel could offer a more complete view of the industry—and help determine whether historical physical patterns still hold in a digital-first world. 

A regional analysis of total sales volume would also provide additional insight into when genre-specific demand declined or shifted from physical to digital.
