# Video Game Market Analysis: GameCo

*This project was completed as part of the [CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program](https://careerfoundry.com/en/courses/become-a-data-analyst/).*

## Overview

GameCo’s board is preparing the 2017 marketing budget and assumes that regional video game sales trends and market shares remained consistent over time. This analysis test that assumption.

## Key Questions
- Are certain types of games more popular than others?
- What publishers dominate specific markets or regions?
- Have any games or genres increased or decreased in popularity over time?
- Have regional sales trends shifted, or do they remain consistent?

## Tools Used 

- **Excel** - Data Profiling | Cleaning | Analysis
- **KeyNote** - Presentation

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data Exploration | Description | Profiling | Quality & Integrity Assessment | Cleaning
- Descriptive Statistics | Trend Analysis
- Deriving Insights | Data Visualisation | Storytelling

## Data Used
The original dataset was sourced from **VGChartz**, and provided by **CareerFoundry** as part of their Data Analytics Course. An additional modified version was provided for practicing cleaning principles. 

[VGChartz Methodology](http://www.vgchartz.com/methodology.php) | [Original Dataset](https://images.careerfoundry.com/public/courses/intro-to-data/E1/vgsales.xlsx) | [Modified Dataset](https://coach-courses-us.s3.amazonaws.com/public/courses/intro-to-data/E4/vgsales_dirty.xlsx)  


## Deliverables
- Presentation (KeyNote | pdf)

## Takeaways
- **Successes**: The project met its core objectives by revealing actionable insights into genre preferences, regional shifts, and publisher dynamics. It clarified executive questions and challenged assumptions about market consistency, while confirming the industry’s shift from physical to digital formats.

- **Challenges**: Managing scope was a key challenge. With many interesting patterns in the data, it was easy to stray from the brief. Balancing depth with executive relevance required restraint, and the tendency to over-communicate insights highlighted the importance of concise messaging.

- **Way Forward**: Future efforts should stay closely aligned with stakeholder goals before exploring adjacent questions. Executive materials should favour clarity—brief bullets on slides, with detailed context reserved for presenter notes.
A regional breakdown of total sales volume would enhance the overall analysis and strengthen the response to Question 4 by clarifying when and where demand shifted toward digital formats.
Next steps could include sourcing digital sales data to compare trends with historical physical sales.
